# Python-Data-Structure-and-Algorithm(continuous updating)

## Motivation about the project
I learnt data structures and algorithms by myself, and I learnt them in Java in the first place.
To help myself to understand them better and also reinforce my memory while having the Data Structure 
and Algorithm course in HKUST, I decided to do this project.

## What have been done:
### Data Structure
1. [Linked List](https://github.com/ppxwdy/Python-Data-Structure-and-Algorithm/tree/main/Linked%20List)

2. [BST](https://github.com/ppxwdy/Python-Data-Structure-and-Algorithm/tree/main/Tree)

### Algorithms
1. [sorts] (https://github.com/ppxwdy/Python-Data-Structure-and-Algorithm/tree/main/Sort%20Algorithms)
